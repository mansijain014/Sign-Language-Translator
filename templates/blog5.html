          <h2>Know the main barriers of accessibility and how to overcome them!</h2>
          <p>
            What is accessibility for you? The first thing we think about is access ramps, exclusive parking spaces, preferential seat on the bus… These things really make places more accessible, but is that all? People with disabilities encounter many obstacles in their daily lives, which go far beyond the physical space. 
            The barriers that accessibility needs to overcome are varied, and today we are going to talk about the three main groups: architectural, communicational and attitudinal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Architectural barriers</b><br>
            Architectural barriers are all kinds of obstacles that prevent people from enjoying and occupying physical space. They are the easiest to identify and are present both in homes and commercial establishments and in the public space.
            What few people notice is that the way streets, sidewalks and pedestrian crossings are made is also very important. Those who depend on crutches or a wheelchair, for example, need to think carefully about the path they will take before leaving home. 
            Locomotion is also important in closed environments - such as shopping malls, museums and schools - where the arrangement of furniture and objects can facilitate or hinder movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Communication barriers</b>
            Another aspect that complicates the lives of people with disabilities is communication. It is a barrier when information is not available to everyone, either because it does not exist or because it is not presented in an accessible way. Communication barriers occur basically in three ways:
          </p>    
            <ul>
                <li>In interpersonal communication: when, for example, you are going to talk to a deaf person and do not know American Sign Language, communication is compromised in a very obvious way. In addition, a frequent problem is in the way of addressing people with disabilities - who are often called “disabled”, for example.</li>
                <li>In written communication: when important information is not available in Sign Language or Braille - which happens a lot in libraries, signposts and even on websites!</li>
                <li>In virtual spaces: when there is no digital accessibility, the websites are making it difficult for certain people to access their information. The lack of automatic translation, audio description and alternative texts in the images also comes in here. A lot of people think that making a website accessible is a difficult job and is not worth doing. But, following a few simple tips the process is easy and brings incredible results – like improving page placement in Google searches!</li>
            </ul> 
          <p>
            <b>Attitudinal barriers</b><br>
            The most difficult barriers to perceive are raised by ourselves. But luckily they are the easiest to break down, and the ones that have the greatest impact on people's lives. Some of our attitudes towards people with disabilities can reinforce communication and architectural barriers. These are our prejudices and stereotypes. And make no mistake, everyone has prejudices, and there is nothing bad about wanting to end them. But, for that, it is necessary to seek information and be willing to know more about the other, regardless of who it is!
            <br>In the end the most important thing is to do your best to break down these different types of barriers on a daily basis. Searching for information and communicating is always the best way to start and you can always count on our blog for that!
